# Interactive Examples 

## Basic Example
This example demonstrates the basic usage of the R3FPointsFX library without any modifier functions.
<ExamplesSandpack scene='scene1' height={656} />
<VerticalSpacer height={100} />
   
## Color Mixing Example
This example demonstrates the usage of fragment modifier function, also covers how to pass your custom uniforms to the shader.
<ExamplesSandpack scene='scene2' height={656} />
<VerticalSpacer height={100} />

## Prop Control Example
This example demonstrates how to control transition using a reactive prop for changing the models.
<ExamplesSandpack scene='scene3' height={656} />
<VerticalSpacer height={100} />

## Vertex Modifier Example
Using the vertex modifier function to modify the positions of the points, also notice the usage of a user defined attribute `aPositionOffset` to add randomness to the points' positions.
<ExamplesSandpack scene='scene4' height={656} />
<VerticalSpacer height={100} />
