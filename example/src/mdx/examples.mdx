# Interactive Examples 

## Basic Example
This example demonstrates the basic usage of the R3FPointsFX library without any modifier functions.
<ExamplesSandpack scene='scene1' height={656} />
<VerticalSpacer height={100} />
   
## Color Mixing Example
This example demonstrates the usage of fragment modifier function, also covers how to pass your custom uniforms to the shader.
<ExamplesSandpack scene='scene2' height={656} />
<VerticalSpacer height={100} />

## Prop Control Example
This example demonstrates how to control transition using a reactive prop for changing the models.
<ExamplesSandpack scene='scene3' height={656} />
<VerticalSpacer height={100} />

## Vertex Modifier Example
Using the vertex modifier function to modify the positions of the points, also notice the usage of a user defined attribute `aPositionOffset` to add randomness to the points' positions.
<ExamplesSandpack scene='scene4' height={656} />
<VerticalSpacer height={100} />

## Progress Modifier Example
This example demonstrates basic the usage of the `progressModifier` function to control the transition between different models. Here we have a simple cubic bezier curve applied to the progress value.
<ExamplesSandpack scene='scene5' height={656} />
<VerticalSpacer height={100} />

## Noisy Progress Example
Usage of the `progressModifier` function to create a noisy transition effect achieved by using a simplex noise function. This gives a more organic feel to the transition between different models.
<ExamplesSandpack scene='scene6' height={656} />
<VerticalSpacer height={100} />

## Scroll Morph Example
This example demonstrates the particle morph transition on scrolling the page content. This particular example uses [**GSAP**](https://gsap.com/) for scroll-based animations and transitions.
<ExamplesSandpack scene='scene7' height={656} />
<VerticalSpacer height={100} />
